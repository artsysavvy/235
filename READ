#Overview#
POLYCHROME is a platformer in which your main goal
is to find the end. You play as a young popstar who is trapped in
this neverending maze of beasts, dangers, and pitfalls.
If you do not escape in time, your memory will be completely
forgotten. Nobody will know who your are, or even remember your
existence. You will simply be a ghost of who you once were,
and you will be forced to remain in the maze forever more. 

#High Concept#
It's Mario Brothers meets Undertale, with a dash of
OFF!

#Genre#
POLYCHROME is an escape RPG with platformer elements.

#Platform#
The demo for POLYCHROME will be playable in a web browser,
with the full game expanding to be played on desktop.

#Story#
On the surface, you are a rising pop star who has been
plunged the depths of a maze engineered by the Game Master. 
You are trapped and must find a way out.
The game is story-centric, and introduces themes of
depression, loneliness, and the fear of being forgotten.

#Gameplay#
The game uses the WASD control keys, but may also be played
with the arrow keys. The left mouse button will be used to attack,
and the right mouse button will be used to interact with objects
/ people.
The beginning of the game features a two-minute tutorial of the gane,
where the player learns the key commands and such.
